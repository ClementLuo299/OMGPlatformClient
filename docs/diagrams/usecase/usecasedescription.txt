Use Case: Login
Iteration: 1
Primary Actor: Existing User
Goal in Context: Allow the existing user to authenticate and gain access to the system's features.
Preconditions:
        1. The system is running and accessible.
        2. The user has an existing account
Scenario:
        1. The user enters their username and password.
        2. The system verifies the credentials against the database.
        3. If valid, the user is taken to the main menu.
        4. If the credentials are invalid, the system displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.
Post Conditions: The user is logged in and can access the system's functionalities or receives an error message and remains logged out.
Exceptions:
        1. The existing filled in the wrong username and password prompting n error message and for the user to retry.
        2. The system displays a message indicating login is unavailable.
        3. The existing user's account does not exist and the system prompts the try again. After successive failures it prompts the user to sign up rather.
        4. System timeout or other technical issues.
Priority: High â€“ Logging in is necessary to access other system functionalities.
When Available: Within the first development iteration.
Frequency of Use: Once per session (or as needed if the session times out).
Channel to Actor: The user interacts with the system via the GUI using a keyboard and mouse/touchscreen.
Secondary Actors: The database to verify credentials.
Channel to Secondary Actors: System interacts with the database via database requests.
Open issues:
        1. Should there be a password recovery option?
        2. Should multi-factor authentication be implemented?
