I. Introduction
This document outlines the potential risks associated with the development of an Online Multiplayer Board Game Platform. It is based on a review of project planning documents submitted by various development sub-teams on Bravo. A wide range of planning documents was used in order to create this report. Effective risk management is crucial for the successful completion of this project. This assessment identifies key risk areas, analyzes their potential impact and probability, and proposes solutions.

II. Risks Identified
Timeline Risks:
    - Several teams have timelines that may be too aggressive or fail to account for potential delays. For example, the GUI Team's plan to implement core GUI components with stubs in just one week (Week 3) could be challenging. This aggressive approach may lead to multiple bugs and create bottlenecks or blockers for progress.
    - The Game Logic and Mechanics Team plans to define core game mechanics and begin coding for four different games in a single week, which could lead to rushed or incomplete implementations filled with bugs.
Integration Risks:
    - The Networking Team identifies the risk of needing to ensure alignment with project goals, which implies a potential risk of misalignment if this is not carefully managed.
    - The Project Plan Integration document mentions the need for heavy communication with other teams, indicating that integration could be a complex process with associated risks if communication is not effective.
Synchronization Risks:
    - The Game Logic and Mechanics Team highlights the need to ensure that multiplayer matches sync properly between players, suggesting a risk of synchronization issues.
Dependency Risks:
    - The GUI Team mentions that the Chat Interface Developer may need to work with the Networking Team, indicating a dependency that could pose a risk if not coordinated properly.
    - GUI roles have dependencies on other teams, like the Profile & Authentication Interface Developer coordinating with the Authentication & Profile Team, which could cause delays if those teams are behind schedule.
Technical Risks:
    - The Initial Draft Documentation mentions potential performance bottlenecks in the networking module when handling a large number of concurrent users.
    - There is a risk of security vulnerabilities in the networking module that require continuous updates to address as addressed in planning documents.
User Experience Risks:
    - There is no clear feedback mechanism for players when actions fail which include events such as failed move submission or/ and unsuccessful login attempts.

III. Analysis of Risk and Their Impact
Timeline Risks:
    - Delays in one team's timeline could have a domino effect on other teams, but the impact could be mitigated if there is strong flexibility built into the overall project schedule. Overall there is a high probability of this occurring during the project duration.
Integration Risks:
    - Integration issues in the project could lead to significant setbacks and potentially affect the final product's functionality and quality. Overall there is a medium probability of this occurring during the project duration.
Synchronization Risks:
    - Synchronization issues in multiplayer games would directly impact the user experience and the core functionality of the platform. Overall there is a medium probability of this occurring during the project duration, but if it does, its impact would be substantial.
Dependency Risks:
    - Dependency issues could cause delays for specific teams or features, but their impact might be limited if alternative solutions or workarounds are available. Overall based on the structure of the project timeline, there is a low probability of this occurring during the project duration.
Technical Risks:
    - Performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities could have severe consequences for the platform's usability, reliability, and security, but they might be less likely if strong and robust design principles and development practices are followed. Overall the chances of this being an issue are low and its impact would not even be a major factor with this being a class group project and not a true piece of work done for a real company or agent.
User Experience Risks:
    - A poor user interface could discourage players from using the platform. Ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience is crucial for engagement and adoption.

IV. Mitigation Strategies
Improved Planning and Communication:
    - Teams should incorporate buffer time into their timelines to account for potential delays.
    - Teams should establish clear communication channels and protocols to ensure effective coordination, especially for tasks with dependencies.
    - The Integration Team should work closely with other teams throughout the development process to identify and address integration issues early on.
Robust Development Practices:
    - The Networking Team should implement error handling and resilience mechanisms to handle failures and ensure robustness.
    - The Authentication Team should coordinate closely with the GUI team to ensure a smooth integration of authentication elements in the user interface.
Testing and Validation:
    - Teams should conduct thorough unit testing and integration testing to identify and fix bugs, synchronization issues, and other technical problems.
    - The Game Logic and Mechanics Team should ensure that multiplayer matches sync properly between players and that game states are consistent.
    - The Networking Team should simulate network interactions to test latency, packet loss, error handling, and recovery.
Security Focus:
    - The Networking Team should establish a security protocol and adhere to it instead of planning on continuous updates to address vulnerabilities.
Code Maintainability Guidelines:
    - The Development Leads should establish a coding standard guide to ensure consistency across all teams.
    - The Repository Maintainers should define a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, bug-fix branches) to streamline version control.
    - The Testing Team should enforce code review requirements before merging changes to prevent broken implementations.
    - Members from other teams should be encouraged to jump to other teams that are code heavy if they are done with their tasks.

V. Conclusion
Identifying and analyzing potential risks is crucial for the success of the Online Multiplayer Board Game Platform project. By implementing appropriate solutions and maintaining a proactive approach to risk management, the development teams can minimize the likelihood and impact of these risks, ensuring the delivery of a high-quality and successful product.
