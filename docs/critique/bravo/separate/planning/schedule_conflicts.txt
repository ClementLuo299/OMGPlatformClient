*Conclusion Section:*

Observations:
The Networking and Authentication teams seemed to be highly organized and synced up with their completion date goals,
resulting in no conflict between these teams. The Statistics team also seems to have effectively matched this schedule
and so has no conflicts with other teams. The GUI team was very broad with their scheduling, but did not encounter any
scheduling conflicts with other teams. The Integration team often schedules themselves as working on things that don't
have to do with integration, this possibly means that integration team members worked in other groups when integration
wasn't needed.

Strong Conflicts:
The Game Logic team opted to begin coding during iteration 2 with no mentions of fulfilling their deliverables. Where
this conflict is most prominent is when the Integration team at the end of Iteration 2 is creating their Letter to the
Reviewed teams as well as the Letter Grade Proposal because the Game Logic team did not complete their portion of the
work required to create these documents. Another instance where this causes conflict is when the Game Logic team at the
is end of Iteration 2 is scheduled to collaborate with other teams because no other team has created code bases yet for
the Game Logic team to perform any form of integration with. Lastly, the Game Logic team schedules themselves to mostly
complete their code before the team has received feedback for their design and planning, which means implementing any
suggestions will be quite difficult and time-consuming.

Weak Conflicts:
In the middle of Iteration 3, all teams participate in collaborative coding, but the Game Logic team is scheduled to
already be done with their code by this point which would make integration more difficult than necessary. Secondly,
in the middle of Iteration 3, the Integration team begins to consolidate everyone's code together as a system where
they then improve both Documentation and Test Cases, however the Networking, Authentication, and Statistics teams are
scheduled later on to improve their own documentation and test cases after this which may cause issues. Lastly, the
teams are scheduled to work together to document Modifications and Improvements made with their team's feedback in
mind, but the Game Logic and GUI teams did not schedule time to document improvements.
