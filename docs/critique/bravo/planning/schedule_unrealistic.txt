The Game Logic team asserts that they can complete 4 separate games during the first half of Iteration 2, then work with
the Networking and Statistics teams to fully integrate their systems by the end of the iteration. This is unrealistic in
a few ways: This scheduling expects that all teams have finished major portions of the OMG system just halfway into the
iteration such that integration work between the systems is even possible. Furthermore, this scheduling expects that
integrating every system together will also only be completed by the end of the iteration. These expectations are not
only unrealistic on their own, but are also expected while the group should be occupied with completing the necessary
critique of two other group's Iteration 1 work.
