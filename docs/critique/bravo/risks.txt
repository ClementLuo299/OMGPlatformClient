I. Introduction
This document outlines the potential risks associated with the development of an Online Multiplayer Board Game Platform. It is based on a review of project planning documents submitted by various development sub-teams on team Bravo. Effective risk management is crucial for the successful completion of this project. This assessment identifies key risk areas, analyzes their potential impact and probability, and proposes mitigation strategies.

II. Potential Risks Identified
Timeline Risks:
    - Several teams have timelines that may be too aggressive or fail to account for potential delays. For example, the GUI Team's plan to implement core GUI components with stubs in just one week (Week 3) could be challenging.
    - The Game Logic and Mechanics Team plans to define core game mechanics and begin coding for four different games in a single week, which could lead to rushed or incomplete implementations filled with bugs.
Integration Risks:
    - The Networking Team identifies the risk of needing to ensure alignment with project goals, which implies a potential risk of misalignment if this is not carefully managed.
    - The Project Plan Integration document mentions the need for heavy communication with other teams, indicating that integration could be a complex process with associated risks if communication is not effective.
Synchronization Risks:
    - The Game Logic and Mechanics Team highlights the need to ensure that multiplayer matches sync properly between players, suggesting a risk of synchronization issues.
Dependency Risks:
The GUI Team mentions that the Chat Interface Developer may need to work with the Networking Team, indicating a dependency that could pose a risk if not coordinated properly.
GUI roles have dependencies on other teams, like the Profile & Authentication Interface Developer coordinating with the Authentication & Profile Team, which could cause delays if those teams are behind schedule.


Technical Risks:
The Initial Draft Documentation mentions potential performance bottlenecks in the networking module when handling a large number of concurrent users.
There is a risk of security vulnerabilities in the networking module that require continuous updates to address.

III. Mitigation Strategies
Improved Planning and Communication:
Teams should incorporate buffer time into their timelines to account for potential delays.
Teams should establish clear communication channels and protocols to ensure effective coordination, especially for tasks with dependencies.
The Integration Team should work closely with other teams throughout the development process to identify and address integration issues early on.
Robust Development Practices:
Teams should prioritize modular architecture and separation of concerns to improve maintainability, scalability, and testability, which can help mitigate technical risks.
The Networking Team should implement error handling and resilience mechanisms to handle failures and ensure robustness.
The Authentication Team should coordinate closely with the GUI team to ensure a smooth integration of authentication elements in the user interface.
Testing and Validation:
Teams should conduct thorough unit testing and integration testing to identify and fix bugs, synchronization issues, and other technical problems.
The Game Logic and Mechanics Team should ensure that multiplayer matches sync properly between players and that game states are consistent.
The Networking Team should simulate network interactions to test latency, packet loss, error handling, and recovery.
Security Focus:
The Networking Team should prioritize security and authentication, with mechanisms to handle user logins and logouts, and continuous updates to address vulnerabilities.


IV. Conclusion
Identifying and analyzing potential risks is crucial for the success of the Online Multiplayer Board Game Platform project. By implementing appropriate mitigation strategies and maintaining a proactive approach to risk management, the development teams can minimize the likelihood and impact of these risks, ensuring the delivery of a high-quality and successful product.
