*Conclusion Section:*

Observations:
Their planning document is incredibly well-made and detailed. There is no Integration team specified, which implies that
integration work is the responsibility of each team. All teams pay particularly strong attention to potential conflicts
in schedules which kept them largely organized and with minimal conflict. The Game Logic team has the most realistic
scope for development with half of their workload as well as their integration work within Iteration 3 instead of the
bulk of it in Iteration 2. The Statistics team had a broad plan that resulted in their team not causing too many issues,
however they also lack several key milestones for the project. This team has very few conflicts, with only one of them
being notably serious.

Strong Conflicts:
Every team indicates that the bulk of their independent coding will occur during Iteration 2 with no mentions made about
the deliverables required for the iteration which could lead to significant bottlenecks by needing to push tasks further
along than initially planned to accommodate completing the unaccounted deliverables. Secondly, the GUI team specifies
working on integration early on during Iteration 2 while the other teams are only just starting to develop their systems
which will block the GUI team from accomplishing their goals on time.

Weak Conflicts:
The Networking team waits until Iteration 2 before creating a written design document which means that they are spending
time on something in Iteration 2 that could have been completed in Iteration 1. The Networking and Statistics teams did
not specify final integration work for Iteration 3 which could mean that other teams are expected to take on that work
when it is not in their schedules. The front-loading of collaborative coding means that the Game Logic branch may have
difficulties with other teams due to not being ready for integration until Iteration 3.
