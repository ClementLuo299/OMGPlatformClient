Every team focuses a major portion of their coding into Iteration 2 which is unrealistic in a few ways: Expecting that
all systems being completed within the first half of the iteration such that integration with other teams is possible by
the second half is an underestimation of the project's workload. Furthermore, expecting every team to be able to stick
to this rather truncated schedule makes it so that any deviations will result in many blockers for other teams and force
the group to put substantial time into rescheduling everything to fix those blockers. These expectations also place very
little work into Iteration 3, which is the longest of the Iterations because the coding work is the most in depth of the
project's entire workload. Iteration 2 is supposed to be predominantly dedicated to the critiquing of other group's
design and planning documents, but there is very little room in this schedule to accommodate that workload.
By overlapping intense development work with integration and document review, the current plan results in spreading team focus too thin, which can lead to burnout and lower-quality outputs across all deliverables.
